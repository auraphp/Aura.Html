## Getting Started

The easiest way to instantiate a _HelperLocator_ with all the available helpers is to use the _HelperLocatorFactory_:

```php
<?php
$factory = new \Aura\Html\HelperLocatorFactory;
$helper = $factory->newInstance();
?>
```

You can then use the helpers by calling them as methods on the _HelperLocator_ instance.  
See the [tag helpers](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Html/blob/functions/README-HELPERS.md) 
and [form helpers](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Html/blob/functions/README-FORMS.md) pages for more information.

### Escaping

(N.b.: All helpers escape values appropriately; see the _Escaper_ class internals for more information.)

One of the tasks with PHP-based template systems is to escape output properly. Invoking 
escaper functionality is often verbose makes the template code look cluttered.  
This package comes with four namespaced escaper functions to reduce the verbosity and 
clutter:  `a()`, `c()`, `j()`, and `h(). These escape values for HTML attributes, 
CSS, JavaScript, and HTML values, respectively.

To call the namespaced escaper functions in a PHP-based template, `use` the _EscaperFunctions_ 
namespace, then call the functions as you would any other function.

Here are contrived examples of `h()` and `a()` in use:

```php
<?php use Aura\Html\EscaperFunctions; ?>

<h1><?= h($blog->title) ?></h1>

<p class="byline">by <?= h($blog->author) ?> on <?= h($blog->date) ?></p>

<div id="<?php a($blog->div_id) ?>">
    <?= $blog->raw_html ?>
</div>
```

Here are contrived examples of `c()` and `j()` in use:

```php
<?php use Aura\Html\EscaperFunctions; ?>
<style>
body: {
    color: <?= c($theme->color) ?>;
    font-size: <?= c($theme->font_size) ?>;
}
</style>

<script language="javascript">
    var foo = "<?= j($js->foo); ?>";
</script>
